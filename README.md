## 🎯 Guess_the_Number

**Guess_the_Number** is a simple Python guessing game where the player must find a randomly generated number within a limited number of lives.

### 🎮 How the Game Works

* The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 1000**.
* The player has **10 lives** to guess the correct number.
* After each guess, the game gives a hint:

  * **“go up”** if the guess is too low
  * **“go down”** if the guess is too high
* Each incorrect guess costs one life.
* The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of lives.
